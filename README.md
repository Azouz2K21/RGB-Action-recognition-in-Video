# Real-Time Action Detection Deep Learning Model

## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model designed for real-time action detection using NTU data, specifically Skeletal and RGB data. The model predicts the actions of an object in real-time, with Python as the primary programming language for development.

## Features
- Deep learning model for real-time action detection
- Utilizes NTU data, including Skeletal and RGB data
- Image processing and analysis with OpenCV
- Implementation of the deep learning model using TensorFlow
- Leveraging CUDA for GPU acceleration to optimize computational performance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- CUDA
